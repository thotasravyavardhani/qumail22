Team Contact: techtorndoes@gmail.com
Project Status: Smart India Hackathon (SIH) Entry & Non-Commercial Demonstration
1. Introduction and Purpose
This Privacy Policy applies to the QuMail Quantum Secure Email Client (SIH 2025), a non-commercial desktop application developed for the Smart India Hackathon.
We are committed to the security and privacy of user data, adhering to strict principles of minimal data collection and robust protection. This policy ensures compliance with the strict guidelines for access to the Yahoo Mail API.
 2. Information We Access and Process
QuMail adheres to the principle of minimum necessary data access. The application accesses and processes the following private user data strictly for the purpose of enabling the secure email service:
Identity Data: User's Email Address (via OpenID Connect scope) and Display Name.
Mail Content: Encrypted and decrypted email messages, message headers, and folder information (via IMAP/SMTP mail scopes).
Authentication Data: Secure OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens.
3. Data Usage, Security, and Compliance Guarantee
     A. Data Usage and Monetization (Non-Commercial Guarantee)
Purpose: Information is used solely to provide the QuMail secure email service to the end-user (send, receive, store, and manage email) and for judging/demonstration purposes during the SIH event.
Non-Monetization: We DO NOT use any data obtained through the Yahoo Mail API for advertising, targeting, profiling, monetization, or analytics. The application is strictly non-commercial and free.
 No Sharing: We DO NOT share, sell, rent, or transfer any user data, including email content or metadata, to any third parties.
B. Security Measures (Based on QuMail Codebase)
    QuMail employs the following security measures, as detailed in the project's architecture:
End-to-End Encryption: All sensitive data is protected by ISRO-grade quantum-aided cryptography (L1, L2, L3) while in transit and processing.
Secure Storage: Authentication tokens and login credentials are stored using OS-native secure storage (`keyring`), isolating them from the file system for protection.
Memory Safety: Cryptographic keys and sensitive data are immediately zeroized from memory after use, preventing data persistence or leakage.
 4. User Rights and Contact
As the data subject, you have the right to understand and control QuMail's access to your data. You may revoke access to this application at any time by visiting your Yahoo Account Security settings.
